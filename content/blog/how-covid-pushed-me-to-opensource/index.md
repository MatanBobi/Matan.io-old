### Intro

Before I start, I want to offer my sincere condolences to everyone who suffered and are still suffering from COVID-19. It has changed our lives upside down but unfortunately it's not behind us yet. Stay safe, keep wearing a mask and get vaccinated if you can.
This is a short personal retrospective of the last year that will mainly focus on my Open Source work and will also include some tips. I hope you'll find them useful.

### Quarantines, lockdowns and everything between

Back at February 2020, I came back from a honeymoon in Thailand. 
COVID-19 has just started and my flight was the first flight to land in Israel and sent to self quarantine. For the first time in my life, I didn't need to get out of home to work, I had around 2 hours of extra time a day.
I decided to make an effort and give Open Source a try, but I had a major mental barrier: Am I capable enough to even contribute to Open Source? And even if I am, to which repo should I contribute? I don't know everything going on in any repo, I'm just using them. And these were fair questions at the time.

The only thing I didn't realise is that **nobody** knows everything and I am capable to contribute because I **want** to contribute.
Regarding the last point, I decided to follow [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)'s advice and try to contribute to projects I use daily.
